[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/solid/webid-profile](https://badges.gitter.im/solid/webid-profile.svg)](https://gitter.im/solid/webid-profile?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Initially, Type Indexes were discussed and worked on together with the [WebId Profile Spec](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile). During this work we came to the conclusion to separate the index topic from the webId profile. The igniting issue is documented [here](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/issues/35) and decision discussions were conducted at the WebID weekly meetings respectively [here](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/blob/main/meetings/2022-08-23.md#separation-of-index-content) and [here](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/blob/main/meetings/2022-08-30.md#separation-of-index-content).

Further conversation on this work is discussed on the [WebId profile gitter chat](https://gitter.im/solid/webid-profile) and [weekly meetings](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/tree/main/meetings). Feel free to [open a GitIssue](https://github.com/solid/type-indexes/issues/new) in this repo if you want to contribute or have a remark/improvement suggestion/concern.

## This Type Indexes spec is:
...first and foremost, trying to simply document what-is. This means, we are documenting how type indexes are implemented and used NOW.

We have taken into account the [initial proposal](https://github.com/solid/solid/blob/main/proposals/data-discovery.md#type-index-registry) in our current work.

## Future Type Index versions:
...might build on top of this spec. We started collecting ideas on a dedicated [git ticket](https://github.com/solid/type-indexes/issues/1). If you want to start discussion on one of those ideas, feel free. In order to have them considered for future iterations of this document please label the ticket with `discussion` and `future iteration` please.

...might speak about other types of indexes, in their own dedicated repositories.
